# Numpy homework

This module is a slight extension of some functions from the NumPy library. 

1. three of my favourite arrays are called ```a1```, ```a2```, and ```a3```;
2. ```matrix_multiplication``` takes 2 matrices and outputs matrix multiplication;
3. ```multiplication_check``` takes a list of matrices and outputs ```bool``` as the possibility of their multiplication;
4. ```multiply_matrices``` takes a list of matrices and outputs either their multiplication or ```None``` based on ```multiplication_check```;
5. ```compute_2d_distance``` takes two 1D arrays each with 2 values and calculates Euclidian distance between points;
6. ```compute_multidimensional_distance``` takes two 1D arrays and calculates Euclidian distance regardless of dimensions;
7. ```compute_pair_distances``` takes a 2D array and calculates a distance matrix.
